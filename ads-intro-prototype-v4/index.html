			<h1>BookBub Ads</h1>
			<h3>Ads let you reach millions of engaged readers and give you complete control over your marketing strategy.</h3>

					<h3 class="head">Not everyone's a marketing guru. That's why we're here to help.</h3>
					<p>This quick, two minute overview will introduce some key principles of BookBub Ads, which appear in a dedicated space at the bottom of BookBub's daily emails.</p>
					<a id="link0" href="#"><button>Get Started</button></a>

					<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i><h3 class="head">BookBub Ads give you a flexible way to reach millions of readers.</h3>
					<p>Unlike BookBub's Featured Deals, BookBub Ads can be used to promote any book at any price at any time. Ads aren't subject to an editorial review process, so you can launch a campaign whenever you want and let it run for as long as you'd like. You decide your own budget and choose your own ad image. Lastly, Ads offer new, powerful targeting options that allow you to choose which readers see your ad.</p>
					<a id="link1" href="#"><button>Ok, got it</button></a><span class="learn-link"><a href="#">LEARN MORE</a></span>
					</div>

					<div id="content2">
					<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i><h3 class="head">Customize your campaigns by choosing the targeting and pricing that makes sense for you.</h3>
					<p>BookBub Ads use an auction model to determine when ads will serve. Advertisers tell us how much they're willing to pay for impressions from their target audience and the highest bidder's ad will serve to those readers. This means you'll never pay more than you're willing to for views of your ad.
					</p>
					<p>The total amount you spend on a BookBub Ads campaign is also entirely up to you. You can run a $10 ad, or spend $1,000 or more.</p>
					<a id="link2" href="#"><button>Got it</button></a><span class="learn-link"><a href="#">LEARN MORE</a></span>
					</div>

					<div id="content3">
					<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i><h3 class="head">The key to success? Testing.</h3>
					<p>The auction model gives advertisers control, but it also means results are variable. The most successful advertisers will run a lot of test campaigns to find out what works best given their marketing goals. We'd recommend starting with a few low budget ads to test different bids, targeting options, and creative variations until you find a combination that works.</p>
