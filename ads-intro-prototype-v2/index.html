					<h3 class="head">How ad auctions work</h3>
					<p>Unlike Featured Deals, BookBub Ads are run using an auction model, and advertisers set their own bid and budget for each ad campaign. If you are the highest bidder for the audience you're targeting, you will win impressions and pay one cent more than the price of the second-highest bid for those impressions. Ads are priced by the Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM), which means advertisers bid however much they value 1,000 views of their ad.</p>
					<p>The amount you spend on BookBub Ads is entirely up to you. You can run a $10 campaign or a $10,000+ campaign (or anything in between). We will never charge you more than your maximum budget. The amount you pay for each ad impression, however, will depend on factors like the targeting you select and the bids other advertisers submit for the same audience at the same time. Because of this, the cost for an individual impression will always be variable, though you will never pay more than the maximum CPM you bid when you set up your campaign.</p>
					<p>Average winning bid prices can very based on the popularity of the targeting you choose. Greater popularity can also mean a higher click-through-rate (CTR) on your ad, so it's advised to try a few different strategies.</p>

					<h3 class="head">The differences between Ads and Featured Deals</h3>
					<div class="card-copy">
					<p>BookBub Ads appear in a dedicated space at the bottom of BookBub emails. Unlike Featured Deals, BookBub Ads can be used to promote any book at any time, regardless of length or price point. There are several other differences: Ads are not subject to an editorial review process, pricing on the platform is determined by an auction model rather than a flat fee, Ads offers enhanced targeting options and additional control, and running an Ads campaign doesn't impact your eligibility for a Featured Deal.
					</p>
					<p>However, advertisers should note that results are typically less predictable and more variable on BookBub Ads than Featured Deals.</p>
