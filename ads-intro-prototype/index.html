					<h4>How the ad auction works at BookBub</h4>
					<p>The auction is designed to ensure advertisers have an incentive to bid their true maximum value and to remove incentives for advertisers to bid lower than their true value. An advertiser typically pays no more than what's required to rank higher than the next best ad. So, if you bid $10.00 and the next highest bid is $5.00, you win the autction, but only pay $5.00.</p>
					<p>The bid price is for every 1,000 impressions (CPM) of your ad. Let's say there are 50,000 impressions of your ad, then you would pay $250 if you're winning bid price is $5.00/CPM. You also have the option to pick a max total amount you're willing to pay, which will cause your ad to stop running when it reaches the max.</p>
					<p>Average winning bid prices can very based on the popularity of the targeting you choose. Greater popularity can also mean a higher click-through-rate (CTR) on your ad, so it's advised to try a few different strategies.</p>

					<h4>The differences between Ads and Featured Deals</h4>
					<p>You may be familiar with featured deals on BookBub, but it's importnat to know that there are a few key differences between Featured Deals and Ads.</p>
					<p>A Featured Deal is a significant discounted ebook or series that is strictly curated to the BookBub audience. Featured deals are all about performance, but a relatively small number are accepted from partners.</p>

You can advertise any book related content, be that a full price new release, preorder or back-listed book. Entering a landing page URl for the Ad, is great way to promote an Author and gain exposure.</p>
